ang18n
======

[Angular.js](angular) is a fascinating web framework with many great features. However, the support for
internationlization (i18n) out of the box is not always satisfying.

This is a simple todo list application (the hello world of the web), that shows how to use a
[Play!](play) backend in combination with angular to provide decent i18n and localization.

Additionally, this also shows how to use [angular.js](angular) with CoffeeScript.

The app is running on heroku [here](example).
